// ghvanhalen - the profile follows the controller that starts the game, and each slot's kind of controller follows
// the one played.
//
// On the console the controller that presses a button at the title screen ("PRESS ANY BUTTON TO ROCK") plays with
// its own profile. Here there is one profile, the first controller's (the order Windows connected them in), and
// another controller that started the game got the game's "not signed in" message. While the title screen is shown
// (src/quit_prompt.cpp finds its text element each frame), the SDK's primary press window is open: the controller
// that presses first becomes user 0, the profile's, and the other controllers are its guests ("Name (1)", the SDK's
// signin_guests, set in src/startup.cpp), as when guests sign in on the console. docs/second-controller.md.
//
// The game asks a controller port for its kind (sub_823AFCB0: a guitar, the drums, or the singer for a plain gamepad)
// only when the port's controller connects. The keyboard's pad shares slot 0 with the first controller, and the SDK
// answers for the one in the player's hands, which at the start is the controller: with a controller set to sing in
// the launcher (or a kind the game gives the vocals) and the keyboard playing guitar, the keyboard's player was the
// singer (a player's report in GH Metallica, 2026-11-02; its docs/controller-kind.md). When the SDK finds the slot
// played on another kind of controller, the port's update asks again, outside a song. The same after the title
// screen's press swapped two controllers (the game takes no notice of XN_SYS_INPUTDEVICESCHANGED).
