// ghvanhalen - FMOD mixes each block of sound as soon as the sound device has read the one before.
//
// The game's music and sounds go through FMOD's polled output (sub_82291F38): FMOD's mixer thread calls it about every
// millisecond, and it mixes 256-sample blocks into a ring of two, from its cursor up to the block the game's render
// client is reading (a position it reads before taking its lock). The render client (sub_8223A3B0) runs on the SDK's
// audio worker, once for each frame the sound device plays: it mixes its voices, FMOD's ring among them, and submits
// the frame. When FMOD's thread came more than one block (5.3 ms) late, the reader had gone round the ring and the
// blocks in between were never mixed: the song's streams stayed behind the notes by them until a pause (measured in GH
// Metallica: 8 ms late once a second, half a second in a minute; its docs/song-stutters.md). Here FMOD's update runs on
// the audio worker right after each frame the render client reads, so each block is mixed as soon as it is free
// whatever FMOD's thread does, and FMOD's thread only polls. A lock keeps the two from mixing at once while the worker
// takes over (both mixing from the same position mixed blocks twice: the music ran ahead).
//
// GH Metallica's src/fmod_mix.cpp, its sub_82280600 and sub_82228A38 here (the same instructions, 0x11978 further).
